I carried out a survey of the main problems that can be solved with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN);
I understood the convolution operation in depth, applying convolution on 1D and 2D data using the Scipy package;
I took the opportunity to implement the main layers of a CNN through PyTorch;
Finally, I trained a CNN from scratch, using fine tuning and priority feature extraction techniques.
